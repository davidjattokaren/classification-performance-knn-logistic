This is to ensure that each team has an optimal mix of employees who are likely to complete tasks, as well as employees who are unlikely to complete tasks. By using machine learning, the department hopes to be able to quickly (and dynamically) allocate & re-allocate employees to different projects to maximize the overall likelihood of project success.\n",
